[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jest-pnp-resolver.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-pnp-resolver)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/jest-pnp-resolver.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-pnp-resolver)

*This plugin is also available for Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp)), and Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D jest-pnp-resolver
```

## Usage

As of `jest@^24.4.0` you don't need to manually add this package anymore. The default resolver will already use PnP.

Simply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:

```js
module.exports = {
  resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`)
};
```
